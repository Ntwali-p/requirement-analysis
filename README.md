# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is created as part of a learning project on **Requirement Analysis**, a critical phase in software development. The purpose of this repository is to document and explore the process of identifying, analyzing, and defining software requirements. It includes materials, exercises, and examples that demonstrate how requirement analysis helps ensure project success by aligning system design with user needs and business goals.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, gathering, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), ensuring that the final product meets both business objectives and user requirements.

During this phase, analysts work closely with clients, users, and developers to clearly understand **what the system should do** before any design or coding begins. The process typically includes activities such as requirement gathering, documentation, validation, and feasibility analysis.

### **Importance in the SDLC**
1. **Defines Project Scope:** Helps establish clear boundaries and objectives for the project, preventing scope creep.  
2. **Improves Communication:** Ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of system goals and functionality.  
3. **Reduces Development Costs and Errors:** Early clarification of requirements minimizes costly rework and misunderstandings later in the development process.  
4. **Guides Design and Implementation:** Serves as a blueprint for developers, testers, and project managers throughout the SDLC.  
5. **Ensures Customer Satisfaction:** Delivering a product that aligns with user needs and business goals increases overall satisfaction and product success.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is essential because it lays the groundwork for a successful software project. It bridges the gap between **what stakeholders expect** and **what developers build**, ensuring alignment from the start. Below are key reasons why this process is critical in the SDLC:

1. **Prevents Miscommunication and Rework**  
   By clearly documenting and validating requirements early, teams avoid misunderstandings that could lead to costly revisions or project failure later.  

2. **Ensures Project Alignment with Business Goals**  
   Proper analysis ensures that every feature and function of the software directly supports business objectives, maximizing value and efficiency.  

3. **Improves Quality and User Satisfaction**  
   A well-analyzed requirement set leads to a more accurate, reliable, and user-friendly product that meets or exceeds customer expectations.  

4. **Supports Better Planning and Estimation**  
   Clear requirements help project managers create realistic timelines, allocate resources effectively, and estimate budgets with greater accuracy.  

In summary, **Requirement Analysis is the foundation of project success**, ensuring that development efforts are efficient, purposeful, and aligned with the needs of all stakeholders.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves several core activities that ensure a thorough understanding of stakeholder needs and system goals. These activities form the backbone of a successful requirements engineering process.

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  This is the initial step where information is collected from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, meetings, and observation. The goal is to understand their needs, challenges, and expectations for the software system.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  In this activity, analysts dig deeper into the gathered information to uncover hidden, implicit, or conflicting needs. Techniques such as brainstorming, use case analysis, and prototyping are used to refine and clarify requirements.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  All gathered and elicited requirements are organized and documented clearly in a formal document, such as a Software Requirements Specification (SRS). This serves as a reference point throughout the development process.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  The documented requirements are analyzed for completeness, feasibility, and consistency. Models such as use case diagrams, data flow diagrams (DFDs), and entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) are often created to visualize system behavior and interactions.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  In this final activity, the documented requirements are reviewed and confirmed with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and alignment with their needs. Validation helps identify any ambiguities, gaps, or conflicts before development begins.

Each of these activities plays a vital role in transforming vague user expectations into precise, actionable, and testable software requirements.

## Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are generally categorized into two main types: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-functional Requirements**.  
Both are crucial in defining what the system does and how it performs.

### **1. Functional Requirements**

Functional requirements describe **what the system should do** — the specific features, operations, and behaviors that fulfill user needs. They define how the system will respond to particular inputs or actions.

#### **Examples (Booking Management System)**
- The system shall allow users to **create new bookings** for services (e.g., rooms, appointments, or vehicles).  
- The system shall enable users to **view, edit, or cancel bookings** through their dashboard.  
- The system shall send **email or SMS confirmations** to customers after a successful booking.  
- The system shall allow **administrators to manage availability** and update booking slots.  
- The system shall generate **daily and monthly reports** of all completed and pending bookings.

### **2. Non-functional Requirements**

Non-functional requirements specify **how the system performs** its functions rather than what it does. These include performance, security, usability, reliability, and scalability — all of which impact the system’s quality and user experience.

#### **Examples (Booking Management System)**
- The system shall handle **at least 500 concurrent user sessions** without performance degradation.  
- The system shall have **99.9% uptime** during business hours.  
- The system shall encrypt all **user data and payment information** for security.  
- The system’s **page load time shall not exceed 2 seconds** under normal conditions.  
- The system shall be **mobile-responsive** and accessible across all modern browsers and devices.  

In short, **functional requirements** define the *actions and behaviors* of the booking system, while **non-functional requirements** define the *quality standards* and *performance expectations* of those actions.
