# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is created as part of a learning project on **Requirement Analysis**, a critical phase in software development. The purpose of this repository is to document and explore the process of identifying, analyzing, and defining software requirements. It includes materials, exercises, and examples that demonstrate how requirement analysis helps ensure project success by aligning system design with user needs and business goals.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** are the predefined conditions that a software feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders, clients, or end users. They clearly define the boundaries of a user story or requirement and establish a common understanding of what “done” means for that functionality.

Acceptance criteria are essential in Requirement Analysis because they ensure that all project participants — developers, testers, and clients — have the same expectations for how a feature should behave. Well-defined criteria help prevent misunderstandings, guide testing, and confirm that the delivered product meets business goals.

### **Importance of Acceptance Criteria**
- **Clarity and Transparency:** Ensure that all stakeholders share a common understanding of the expected outcome.  
- **Improved Testing and Validation:** Provide measurable standards for QA teams to verify that the system meets requirements.  
- **Reduced Rework:** Prevent ambiguity or misinterpretation by defining what success looks like for each feature.  
- **Supports Agile Development:** Serve as a basis for user story validation and sprint acceptance in agile workflows.

### **Example: Acceptance Criteria for the Checkout Feature (Booking Management System)**

**Feature:** Checkout — Allows customers to finalize a booking by providing payment and confirmation details.

#### **Acceptance Criteria**
1. The system shall allow a customer to proceed to checkout after selecting a booking.  
2. The checkout page shall display the booking summary (date, time, service, and total cost).  
3. The user shall be able to enter valid payment details (credit card, mobile money, or PayPal).  
4. The system shall validate payment information before processing.  
5. Upon successful payment, the system shall generate a **booking confirmation number**.  
6. A **confirmation email or SMS** shall be sent automatically to the customer.  
7. If payment fails, an **error message** shall be displayed, and the user shall be prompted to retry or use another payment method.  
8. The system shall securely record all transaction data in the booking database.

### **Summary**
Acceptance Criteria act as a **bridge between requirements and validation**.  
For the booking system, they ensure that every user interaction — such as checking out — delivers the exact behavior and experience that stakeholders expect.  
They also make it easier for the QA team to test each feature objectively and confirm project success.
