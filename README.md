# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is created as part of a learning project on **Requirement Analysis**, a critical phase in software development. The purpose of this repository is to document and explore the process of identifying, analyzing, and defining software requirements. It includes materials, exercises, and examples that demonstrate how requirement analysis helps ensure project success by aligning system design with user needs and business goals.

## Use Case Diagrams

**Use Case Diagrams** are visual tools used in requirement analysis to show how users (actors) interact with a system. They illustrate the system’s functional requirements by highlighting different user roles and the actions they can perform.  

Use case diagrams help simplify complex system behavior into an easy-to-understand model, making it clear who does what within the system.

### **Benefits of Use Case Diagrams**
- Provide a **visual overview** of system functionality and user interactions.  
- Help identify **actors** (users or external systems) and their **goals**.  
- Serve as a **communication bridge** between technical and non-technical stakeholders.  
- Assist in defining the **system boundaries** and clarifying requirements before development.

### **Booking Management System — Use Case Diagram**

Below is an example of a **Use Case Diagram** for a Booking Management System.  

It represents the key actors and their interactions with the system.

#### **Actors**
- **Customer:** Creates, modifies, or cancels a booking.  
- **Administrator:** Manages booking records, availability, and system reports.  
- **Payment Gateway:** Processes payment transactions securely.  

#### **Main Use Cases**
- Create Booking  
- Modify Booking  
- Cancel Booking  
- View Booking History  
- Manage Availability  
- Generate Reports  
- Process Payment

### **How to Create the Diagram (Instructions)**

1. Open **[Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net)** or a similar tool (Lucidchart, Creately, or Figma).  
2. Choose **“Blank Diagram”** → name it `alx-booking-uc`.  
3. Use **actors (stick figures)** to represent:
   - Customer  
   - Administrator  
   - Payment Gateway  
4. Add **use cases (ellipses)** for:
   - Create Booking  
   - Modify Booking  
   - Cancel Booking  
   - View Booking History  
   - Manage Availability  
   - Generate Reports  
   - Process Payment  
5. Connect each actor to their relevant use cases using solid lines.  
6. Add a **system boundary box** labeled “Booking Management System.”  
7. Export the diagram:  
   - **File → Export As → PNG**  
   - Save as: `alx-booking-uc.png`  
8. Upload the PNG file to your GitHub repository root folder (`requirement-analysis/alx-booking-uc.png`).  
9. Confirm it displays in the README by viewing the rendered Markdown preview.

### ✅ Commit Instructions

Once the file and diagram are ready:

1. Upload `alx-booking-uc.png` to your GitHub repo.  
2. Open **README.md → Edit (✏️)**.  
3. Paste the new **Use Case Diagrams** section (above).  
4. Commit with a message:  
   **“Added Use Case Diagram and linked image (alx-booking-uc.png)”**

Would you like me to generate the **actual Draw.io diagram layout (XML code)** so you can import it directly into Draw.io and export as PNG easily?
